props: Icon
---

## Basic Usage

Assign any of the icon classnames to an i element to get an icon. Note that we like to reserve i for icons, so if you need to emphasize text, consider using `em`.

```jsx tabs
import { Icon } from 'earth-ui'

const IconBasic = () => {
  return <Icon type="myapps" />
}
```
